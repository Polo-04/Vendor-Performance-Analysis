# Vendor-Performance-Analysis

Project Overview

This project analyzes vendor and inventory performance to improve profitability and efficiency in the retail and wholesale sector. Using exploratory data analysis (EDA), it identifies underperforming brands, top-performing vendors, inventory inefficiencies, and the impact of bulk purchasing on unit costs.

Key Insights

Underperforming Brands: 198 brands with high margins but low sales, requiring promotional or pricing adjustments.
Vendor Dependency: Top 10 vendors contribute 65.69% of purchases, creating supply chain risks.
Bulk Purchasing Impact: Large orders reduce unit costs by 72%.
Inventory Inefficiency: $2.71M tied in unsold stock, indicating slow-moving inventory.
Profitability Variance: High-margin vendors face low sales volumes, while top-selling vendors need cost optimization.

Methodology

Data cleaning: Removed transactions with zero or negative profit and unsold stock.
Statistical analysis: Hypothesis testing confirmed significant differences in profit models between vendor groups.
Correlation analysis: Showed weak links between prices and profitability but strong correlation between purchases and sales.
